MySQL is the world’s most popular open-source database application and is commonly used with PHP. The MySQL software
comes with the database server (which stores the actual data), different client
applications (for interacting with the database server), and several utilities. .

Since the earliest releases, the MySQL developers have focused on performance, even
at the cost of a reduced feature set. To this day, the commitment to extraordinary speed
has not changed, although over time the formerly lacking capabilities have grown to
rival many of the commercial and open source competitors.

Although many open source projects enjoy an active user community, MySQL’s user
community might better be defined as hyperactive. For starters, there are thousands of open
source projects under way that depend upon MySQL as the back end for managing a
broad array of information, including server log files, e-mail, images, Web content,
help desk tickets, and gaming statistics. If you require advice or support, you can use
your favorite search engine to consult one of the hundreds of tutorials written regarding
every imaginable aspect of the software; browse MySQL’s gargantuan [manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/); or pose a
question in any of the high-traffic MySQL-specific newsgroups like [Stack Overflow](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/). In fact, when researching
MySQL, the problem isn’t so much one of whether you’ll find what you’re looking for,
but where to begin!

We've now got Windows installed on our computer, Apache installed and running as our Web Server, it's now time to install MySQL as our Database Server.
You can download the MySQL software by navigating to the MySQL
Web site <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_blank">Downloads section</a>  and click on the blue download button.
