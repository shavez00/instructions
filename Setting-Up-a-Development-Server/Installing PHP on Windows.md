Now we're going to install PHP on our computer.

First you need to determine whether you are running a [32bit(x86) or 64bit(x64) version of Windows] (https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554).

In order to do that, click the Start button, in the search box type "system" and click System in the Programs list.

The operating system is displayed as follows:
For a 64-bit version operating system, 64-bit Operating System appears for the System type under System.
For a 32-bit version operating system, 32-bit Operating System appears for the System type under System.

Write down which version your computer is.

Now it's time to download the latest PHP 7 ZIP package from [www.php.net/downloads.php] (http://windows.php.net/download#php-7.0).

Depending on your version of Windows, select the proper "Thread Safe" download.
