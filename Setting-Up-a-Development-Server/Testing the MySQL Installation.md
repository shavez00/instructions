You can now test the installation by entering either of the following URLs into your
web browser to call up the screen shown in Figure 2-18:
 http://localhost:10088
 http://127.0.0.1:10088

The word localhost specifies the local computer, which will also respond to the IP
address 127.0.0.1. The reason for entering :10088 is because many Mac computers will
already have a web server running: adding this avoids any clashes. You must therefore
remember to place :10088 after every http://localhost for all examples in this book. So,
for example, if the filename test.php is being used, you would call it up from the browser
using the URL http://localhost:10088/test.php.
