WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP are abbreviations for “[**W**indows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), [**A**pache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server), [**M**ySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/what-is-mysql.html), and
[**P**HP](https://secure.php.net/),” “**M**ac, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP,” and “[**L**inux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux), **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP,” respectively. These abbreviations describe a fully functioning setup used for developing dynamic Internet web pages.  WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of a package that binds the bundled programs together so that you don’t have to install and set them up separately. This means you can simply download and install a single program and follow a few easy prompts to get your web development server up and running in the quickest time with the minimum hassle.  During installation, several default settings are created for you. The security configurations of such an installation will not be as tight as on a [production web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment), because it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should never install such a setup as a production server.  However, for developing and testing websites and applications, one of these installations should be entirely sufficient.
