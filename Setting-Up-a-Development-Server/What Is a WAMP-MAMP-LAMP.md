WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP are abbreviations for “[Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), Apache, MySQL, and
PHP,” “Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,” and “Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,”
respectively. These abbreviations describe a fully functioning setup used for developing
dynamic Internet web pages.
WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of a package that binds the bundled
programs together so that you don’t have to install and set them up separately. This
means you can simply download and install a single program and follow a few easy
prompts to get your web development server up and running in the quickest time with
the minimum hassle.
During installation, several default settings are created for you. The security configurations
of such an installation will not be as tight as on a production web server, because
it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should never install such a setup as
a production server.
However, for developing and testing websites and applications, one of these installations
should be entirely sufficient.
