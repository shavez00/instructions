There are several available WAMP servers, each offering slightly different configurations, for these exercises we're going to 
use Zend Server CE (where CE stands for Community Edition), because it’s free and is from the developers of PHP itself. You 
can download it from the [ZendCE website](http://tinyurl.com/zendce).
I recommend you always download the latest stable release (in this instance it’s 5.6.0
SP1 for Windows), which will be listed first in the download section of the web page.
The page should display the correct installer for your computer: Linux, Windows, or
OS X. You will be asked to log in before you download. You can click a link to get the
file without logging in or registering, but you’ll miss out on product update emails and
other news.
