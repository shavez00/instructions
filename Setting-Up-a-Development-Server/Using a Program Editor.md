Although a plain text editor works for editing HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, there
have been some tremendous improvements in dedicated program editors, which now
incorporate very handy features such as colored syntax highlighting. Today’s program
editors are smart and can show you where you have syntax errors before you even run
a program. Once you’ve used a modern editor, you’ll wonder how you ever managed
without one.

There are a number of good programs available, but I have settled on Notepad++, because
it’s free and [OpenSource](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). 

Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.

Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
