We've got Windows installed on our computer and now we've installed the Apache Web Server, the next step in our WAMP Stack is to get MySQL installed and running.

MySQL is an Open Source database.

Databases are programs that store information and make it easy to get to.  

We're already familiar with files.  Files are information that is stored on our computers, like pictures, music, and word documents.  We find these files and double click on them to open them up and see what's inside of them.  Files are like pieces of paper on a desk.

A spcialized type of paper is a piece of graph paper.  With a piece of graph paper you can write information in the little boxes or cells.  Graph paper is very good for organizing information like people's names and birthdays because of the cells which help make organized rows and columns.

You can write your friends names, with each name being in it's own row of cells so that the names are stacked up from the top of the paper to the bottom.  An then next to each name, in the same row, you can write each of your friends birthdays.  You've now created a list of your friends birthdays!

On a computer, there's a special type of file called a spread sheet.  A spread sheet looks just like a piece of graph paper and you can create lists, just like you did on that piece of graph paper.

If you wanted to find a particular friends birthday on your graph paper list, you would start at the top and look down the list until you found the friend you were looking for and then look accross the row to see thier birthday.  In a spread sheet you would do the same thing.  You could look down you list of friends names on your spread sheet until you found the one you were looking for and then look accross the row to see their birhtday.

But unlike your graph paper list, your spread sheet list exists in a computer.  Computers are very good at searching for things.  So instead of you looking down that list, you can have the computer look down that list for you.  While it's easy to track the birthdays for all of your friends, what if you had to track the birthdays for everyone in your school?  Or everyone in your town?  What would take a person, or a team of people, hours to search through boxes of graph paper lists to find that one person's birthday, a computer can find instantaneously.

A database, like MySQL, is a special type of program that you can store information.  You can organize it into rows and columns, just like your graph paper and spread sheet.  But unlike your graph paper, or even a spread sheet, there's no limit to how much information you can store in it.  Databases were specially created to be able to search through large amounts of information super fast.  When you go to Google or YouTube and search for something, what you're really doing is searching a database.  Google has created a database that stores every website ever created and YouTube has created a database that allows us to search through videos.  As part of our WAMP stack, we're going to use the MySQL database to store information so that we can store vast amounts of information and our programs can search through it instantaneously.
