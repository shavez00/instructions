You’ve got PHP installed locally and you’ve got a text editor, Notepad++. Now all you need is an actual program. 

Start your Notepadd++ and select "File" and then "New".  Type in the following code:

<?php
  echo "Hello World!\n";
?>

Next select "File" and then "Save As".  In the "Save as type" dropdown menu at the bottom of the window, scroll down until you see "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor(*.php,*.php3,...)".  Select that choice.  In the text box above that drop down box called "File name", change the name of the file to "index.php".  Now navigate to the top of the window and in the drop down menu called "Save in", select the drop down menu and navigate to your Web Servers document root and select that folder.
